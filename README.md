## 📖 About

This Tool allows you to define a voice command, which you can link to multiple OSC actions. The programm allows to set bool/int/floats. For bool's you can enable a toggle mode, which flips the bool every time you speak the associated command. Right now the tool only triggers if the command is recognised as a standalone word, but there will be an option in the future to always react to commands, even when recognised in a sentence.

### 🏗️ Built With

- **Language/Framework:** Python 3.12
- **Key Libraries / Tools:**
  - [VOSK Voice Recognition](https://alphacephei.com/vosk/) – Used to detect what you are saying

## ⚙️ Installation

Download the latest installer from [releases](https://github.com/DeMuenu/VoiceToOSC/releases) and install it to a non-admin folder. (The standart path works)

## 🚀 Usage
todo

If the programm crashes on startup after you changed something go into the programm folder and delete commands.json and settings.json
